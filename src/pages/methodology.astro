    <h1>How We Build Coverage</h1>
    <p>This page explains sourcing, evidence labels, and update rules used across story files.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="story-shell">
    <h2>Source selection</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Primary references are official release notes, product documentation, and on-record announcements.</li>
      <li>Secondary references add context (industry reporting, analysis, or policy coverage).</li>
      <li>Lower-tier ecosystem signals are used as directional context and never as standalone proof for hard claims.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Source-basis labels</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Multiple primary sources:</strong> two or more primary references.</li>
      <li><strong>Primary + supporting sources:</strong> one primary reference plus additional supporting context.</li>
      <li><strong>Single primary source:</strong> one primary reference and no additional source depth.</li>
      <li><strong>Supporting-source mix:</strong> multiple non-primary references.</li>
      <li><strong>Single supporting source:</strong> one non-primary reference only.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Evidence and risk scores</h2>
    <p>Evidence and risk scores are editorial heuristics used to prioritize follow-up reporting. They are not scientific certainty ratings and may change as new information arrives.</p>

    <h2>Update and correction policy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Material factual changes trigger timestamped updates.</li>
      <li>Confirmed errors trigger correction notes on article pages and entries on the <a href="/corrections/">corrections log</a>.</li>
      <li>Source lists are preserved so readers can inspect provenance directly.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
