    <h1>Editorial Policy</h1>
    <p>VideoGenNews publishes source-linked reporting with visible standards and correction workflows.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="story-shell">
    <h2>Sourcing standards</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Primary sources are preferred: official release notes, product documentation, and on-record statements.</li>
      <li>Secondary reports are used for context and identified as such.</li>
      <li>Material factual claims are tied to cited sources.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Attribution and bylines</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Stories include a named author or desk byline.</li>
      <li>Publish and update timestamps are shown on article pages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Independence and conflicts</h2>
    <p>Editorial decisions are made independently of sponsors and commercial partners. Potential conflicts are disclosed when relevant.</p>

    <h2>AI and generated media coverage</h2>
    <p>Model claims are evaluated against reproducible evidence, benchmark context, and primary documentation wherever available.</p>

    <h2>Corrections and updates</h2>
    <p>When errors are confirmed, we correct quickly and visibly. See our <a href="/corrections/">Corrections Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Method transparency</h2>
    <p>For how we select sources, score evidence, and update files over time, see our <a href="/methodology/">Methodology</a>.</p>
